# Python-Collections
List, Tuple, Dictionaries and Set


Lists: are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java).
Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.


Tuple: A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. 
In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.
 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)


Set: A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. 
Python’s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.
 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
 


Dictionary: in Python is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] 
collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, 
Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
Example: {1: “a”, 2: “b”, 3: “c”, 4: “d”, 5: “e”}
